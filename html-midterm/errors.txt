page1: 
rearranged h2 and h3 on this page to put them in order.
added a closing <em> bracketto the word creme fraiche

page2: 
the opening <b> is never closed. I added </b> after the word Inn.
I added a link for bay.

page3:
added a closing <tb> after Lily in the table, then moved it to the next row.
I then changed <Zapata> to <td> instead of <th>.
I then moved the 22 from adrienne's row to olatunkbo's row.
I then moved axelia's name to her correct row.

page4:
Redid all of the formatting for the table. It misunderstood how rows and columns work,
and there were multiple issues with <tr> and <td>. I also changed the table headers to 
actually be table headers to increase accessibility.
