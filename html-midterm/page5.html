    <h1>Errors</h1>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Added boilerplate code to the beginning and end of the document. This included adding a character set and a more descriptive page title, as well as a viewport and content size.</li>

      <li>Rearranged h2 and h3 on this page to put them in order.</li>
      <li>Added a closing &lt;em> bracket to the word creme fraiche.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a link for the segmental arch on wikipedia.</li>
      <li>
        Rearranged tags on the Interior heading to resolve a w3c validator
        issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        The opening &lt;b> is never closed. I added &lt;/b> after the word Inn.
      </li>
      <li>Added a link for bay.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added a closing &lt;tb> after Lily in the table, then moved it to the
        next row.
      </li>
      <li> Added     &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> to the boilerplate at the top.
      </li>
      <li>Changed &lt;Zapata> to &lt;td> instead of &lt;th>.</li>

      <li>Moved axelia's name to her correct row.</li>
      <li>Changed one li element, which was written as &lt;l>, to &lt;li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redid all of the formatting for the table. It misunderstood how rows and
        columns work.
      </li>
      <li>
        There were multiple issues with &lt;tr> and &lt;td>. I also changed the
        table headers to actually be table headers to increase accessibility.
      </li>
      <li>Added boilerplate to the beginning and end.</li>
      <li>Added alt text to the images to increase accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
